**PhD Researcher in AI Safety | University of Warwick**

## Current Research

I'm pursuing a PhD by Publication focused on **few-shot catastrophe prevention** in AI systems.

### Core Research Question

*When we catch AI misbehavior, what's the best way to use that information to prevent future failures?*

### Current Work: Paper 1

Building a benchmark framework to systematically evaluate prevention techniques. This foundation will enable rigorous comparison of different approaches to learning from rare but critical AI failures.

### Research Arc

My PhD follows a four-paper trajectory:

1. **Benchmark Framework** - Establishing systematic evaluation methods for prevention techniques
2. **Technique Comparison** - Evaluating existing approaches using the benchmark
3. **Novel Method** - Developing improved prevention techniques based on benchmark insights
4. **Real-World Application** - Demonstrating practical deployment and impact
