**AI Safety Researcher | Teaching Fellow at University of Warwick**

## About

I'm an AI Safety Researcher investigating safer approaches to AI development through interpretable causal world models and few-shot catastrophe prevention. My research is building toward a PhD by Publication. I also teach Computer Science foundations at the University of Warwick.

## Research Interests

### 1. Scientist AI: Interpretable World Models Without Agency

**Research question:** Can we build safer, more interpretable AI through passive causal world model learning?

I'm exploring whether removing agency (goal-seeking behavior) while retaining learning capability can lead to fundamentally safer AI systems. My approach involves implementing Scientist AI at scale to demonstrate that interpretable causal world models are both practical and safer than black-box optimization.

**Current work:** A 4-paper research arc covering implementation, scalability, safety properties, and application of Scientist AI as an alternative to traditional RL agents.

### 2. Few-Shot Catastrophe Prevention

**Research question:** Can we detect and prevent AI failures using learned causal structures from limited examples?

When we catch AI misbehavior, what's the best way to use that information to prevent future failures? I'm investigating how causal world models can identify dangerous patterns from few examples of AI misbehavior, creating practical tools for AI labs to analyze caught failures and predict similar risks before they occur.

### 3. Infrastructure Sovereignty & Digital Vassalage

**Research question:** Can nations achieve "Sovereign AI" without owning the physical or cloud infrastructure?

I'm examining the power dynamics between nation-states and the cloud provider triopoly (AWS/Microsoft/Google), comparing the UK's "Tiered Sovereignty" model with the Philippines' "Client-State" model. This research explores infrastructure as territory, cloud rent-seeking, and the difference between strategic adaptation and pure dependency.

## Current Phase

**Research:** Foundations and Scientist AI implementation (Paper 1)
**Teaching:** Computer Science foundations at University of Warwick
